# React Training Exercise 2: Language Switching with useContext
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate how to implement language switching on a website using React's useContext hook.

## Project Objective
The main goal is to provide a hands-on example for developers to understand the power and flexibility of React's Context API. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

- Understand how useContext works
- Implement language switching functionality
- Use Next.js for server-side rendering

## Getting Started
First, clone the repository and run the development server:

```bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## How to Use
Navigate to the landing page and you'll see flags at the top of the page. Clicking on these flags will change the language of the content displayed.
